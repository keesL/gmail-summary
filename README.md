# gmail-summary
A project that will log in to a gmail account, find a label, and email a summary of email contents to a given recipient. Not for the faint of heart. Requires messing with Google APIs, OAUTH creds, etc.

Related to (https://github.com/keesL/gmail-purgatory).

To get started, first follow the instructions at (https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python). 
Without the `credentials.json` file, this will not work.
